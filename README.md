# HowManyFingers

A simple iOS app written in Swift 1.2.
The purpose of the app is for the user to "guess" how many fingers someone is holding.

The app checks to make sure that the user accurately guesses between 0-5 (no one has more than 5 fingers). It also checks to make
sure that the user does not leave the textfield empty.

The idea of this app was from "Learn Swift: The Complete iOS Developer Course" off Udemy. I mostly did this app by myself, with 
the exception of UI requirements.
